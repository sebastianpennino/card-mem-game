Memory Game - Exercise
======================

This project is an exercise using a TDD approach

# Project premise

##Functional Requirements

- Create a deck of 30 cards with 15 pairs of matching items (cards can be whatever you'de such a letter, number, word, etc)
- Arrange the cards in a grid randomly with their faces hidden from the player ("face down")
- The user will k a card to reveal ("") it
- The user will k to reveal a second card.  If it matches the first card, they are removed and the player scores.  If it does not match, then the cards are both "ped" back over.
- Once all cards have been matched, allow the user to start a new game.

##Self Imposed Dev Requirements

- Don't use any MVC framework but try to respect the MVC principle (if possible)
- Use a TDD approach (do the test fail, do the code, correct and repeat)
- Try to use plain javascript (not dependand on jQuery or underscore)
- Use common patterns and best practices
- If you have the time use JSDocs style comments
